Get started
==============

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serdukow/easy-aiogram-bot.git
cd easy-aiogram-bot
```
### Webhook
If you want **to use webhook**, ensure you have your own domain.  
Then proceed to [How to Set Webhook](#how-to-set-webhook) 
### Polling
To start bot without webhook, just fill `.env` with your keys, then verify it by run this command in terminal:
```
poetry run pytest tests/test_polling.py
```
then **remove services nginx, certbot** from `docker-compose.yml` and finally:
```
docker compose up --build
```
----------------------
How to set Webhook
==============

To set up the webhook, follow these steps:

1. **Set your domain** in the `.env` file under the `NGINX_HOST` variable.
```
NGINX_HOST=your-domain.com
```
2. **Build and start** the Docker containers using the .env file:
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env build
docker compose run --rm -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

3. **Verify it** by using curl:
```
curl http://your-domain.com
```
If you receive an HTTP 301 redirect, everything is working fine.

4. **Simulate certificate issuance:**

```
docker compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ --dry-run -d your-domain.com
```
If the dry run is successful, you should see a appropriate message

5. **Issue the SSL certificate:**

```
docker compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d your-domain.com
```

6. **Stop the containers:**

```
docker compose kill && docker compose down
```

7. **Update docker-compose.yml for production:**

```
volumes:
# - ./nginx/initial:/etc/nginx/templates/:ro
- ./nginx/templates:/etc/nginx/templates/:ro
  ```

8. **Finally** verify  and restart with the final setup, do not forget to set this vars in `.env`:
```
USE_WEBHOOK=True
``` 
```
WEBHOOK_URL='https://your-domain.com'
```
then run test:
```
poetry run pytest tests/test_webhook.py
```
finally compose
```
docker compose up --build
```

**Renewing SSL Certificate:**
After 3 months, youâ€™ll need to renew the SSL certificate. To do so, run:
```
docker compose up
dockercompose run --rm certbot renew
```
